# urdu-roman-transliterator
Developed a machine transliterator by implementing, training, and evaluating recurrent neural network models (bidirectional encoder-decoder models with attention).

- NLP_Data contains data pre-processing and dividing into buckets based on sentence length.
- The other files then contain the encoder decoder models for each bucket separately.
- The PDF file contains an academic report of our project and goes over the theory, implementation, and results.

I worked on this project with my colleague Naafey Aamer. This was a course project for a graduate level course on Natural Language Processing at LUMS, Pakistan.
